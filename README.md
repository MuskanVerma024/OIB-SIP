# 🔐 Random Password Generator

A secure and customizable password generator developed using Python. This project includes both a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** and a modern, user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Tkinter. Built as part of my internship to demonstrate core Python skills, GUI design, and basic security principles.
